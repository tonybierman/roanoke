<p>Here are photos and plans for my Mini Puppy Jump Gate.  I use this gate as part of my LGD Embedding Process.</p>
<p>I will embed my LGD with my stock as early as eight weeks. I believe in young, full time embedding. But, with some caveats.</p>
<ol>
<li>I get my puppies from working parents who have been on the same kind of stock I have</li>
<li>I have adult mentors in the barnyard</li>
<li>There are no rank, abusive animals in the barnyard (I have voice-trained goats)</li>
<li>My puppies have a safe place to eat drink and sleep. My miniature puppy jumpgate (see below) allows them to come and go at will. I will close them into the safe place for the first few nights on premises using the jumpgate's hinged door.</li>
<li>I do controlled feedings. Puppies are fed in the safe space and stay there until adults have eaten.</li>
</ol>
