title: Daily Protocol for Embedded LGD Puppies
{0}---
<p>
I place a high value on every day of Critical Period. The puppy becomes nearly my top priority during this important time. Yesterday was a typical day for my embedded LGD puppy Magnus. Here’s how it went.</p>
<ul>

<li>5:30 AM Breakfast (2 cups Diamond Natural Large Breed Puppy kibble topped with K9 Puppy Power). Eating is in his safe place, away from livestock and mentor LGD.</li>

<li>6:00 AM Fence line (barn yard) perimeter walk. Recall, follow me training.</li>

<li>6:00-8 AM Free time in barnyard. Spent playing with 2 LGD mentors.</li>

<li>8:00 AM Fence line (barn yard) perimeter walk. Collar on and drag a short lead (4 ft) training</li>

<li>8:00-10 AM Free time in barnyard. Spent playing with 2 LGD mentors.</li>

<li>10:00 AM Husbandry training. Grooming with a stainless steel comb. Mock nail clipping. Lots of touching his body all over to acclimate him to being handled.</li>

<li>10:30-12PM Free time in barnyard. Spent playing with 2 LGD mentors.</li>

<li>12:00 PM: Lunch 2 cups Diamond Natural Large Breed Puppy kibble. Fed in safe place.</li>

<li>1:00 PM: Transfer embedded LGD and livestock from barnyard confinement to day pasture for grazing. Embedded LGD lead goats from herd from point A to point B. Magnus observes and learns how to lead the herd. Recall and follow me training pays off here.</li>

<li>1:00-2:30 PM: Free time in the pasture. Playing, resting.</li>

<li>2:30 PM: Fence line (day run) perimeter walk. Collar on and drag a short lead (4 ft) training</li>

<li>3:00-4 PM: Free time in the pasture. Playing, resting.</li>

<li>4:00 PM: Transfer embedded LGD and livestock from day pasture back to barn yard. Embedded LGD lead goats from one area to the other. Magnus observes and learns how to lead the herd from point A to point B.</li>

<li>5:30 PM Supper. 2 cups Diamond Natural Large Breed Puppy kibble. Fed in safe place.</li>

<li>6:00-8 PM: Free time in barnyard. Spent playing with 2 LGD mentors.</li>

<li>8:00 PM: Evening check/tuck-in for the night (safe place). Puppy heating pad if cold.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Throughout the day Magnus and I will have an addition 2-4 training sessions of 5-10 minutes each. These sessions can include sit/stay or other obedience training, walking on lead, practicing stairs, loading into a truck.
</p>

<p>
This daily routine continues through 16 weeks of age.
